# Project Plan

**Author**: Team 43

## 1 Introduction

The project provides an Android application that allows a user to play a simplified version of the game Scrabble, where the user has the options to play the game, change the game settings, and view the game statistics.

## 2 Process Description

### Design
> The design phase is the start of the application development process. Upon receiving requirements from client stakeholders, the team begins by reviewing those requirements and identifying candidate classes.  During this phase, the team also reviews how we expect the application to be used and defines the main use cases.  The main outcome of this phase will be the production of UML diagrams and other design documentation to be used throughout the project.  The result of this phase will be an implementation and testing plan for the next two phases to commence.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Requirements received from client

**Exit Criteria**

- Appropriate diagrams compiled
- System architecture designed
- Initial testing plan created
- Development team has enough information to begin implementing design

### Implement
> Implementation consists of the development team taking the design artifacts produced during the initial design and turning them into a working application.  The phase begins when there is enough detail and confidence in the design to begin working and there is agreement between the developers and testers about what is to be delivered.  The development team is responsible for breaking the work up into testable increments that allow the project to progress through the following phases.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Use cases modeled
- High-level software architecture determined
- Success criteria for each feature

**Exit Criteria**

- Application features meet agreed upon requirements
- Testing team comfortable with quality of deliverable

### Test
>  During the test phase, the testing team is responsible for ensuring the application meets acceptable quality standards.  This phase of the project overlaps some of the other phases of the project.  It begins with developing a test plan during design.  During implementation, the testers and developers are responsible for implementing automated unit and UI tests for each feature as it is implemented.  This is an iterative process that continues as the application progresses towards a final product.  After development is completed, this phase concludes with testers giving the application a final review to make sure the agreed-upon functionality is present and the application performs with an acceptable level of quality.

**Entrance Criteria**

- Project design realized
- Enough details are known about the application to develop acceptance criteria

**Exit Criteria**

- Development phase completed
- Test plan concluded

### Deliver
> After completing implementation and testing, the last phase consists of delivering the completed product to the client.  Prior to this phase, the method of delivery and deployment plan should be clarified so that the project team understands how the project will be used.  In the event that changes or enhancements are requested, a plan for continuing maintenance and development will need to be agreed upon by the client and the project team.

**Entrance Criteria**
- Completion of Implement and Test phases
- No more functionality required to meet the minimum requirements

**Exit Criteria**
- Successfully deliver the application to the client

## 3 Team

**Team Members:**
Baihan Lin, Joshua Hunsberger, Md. Khaled Hassan, Mariyam Ayoob

**Roles**
- Requirements Analyst
> The requirements analyst is responsible for turning the specification of the project from the client into actionable items and features that our system will implement, as well as reviewing the proposed design to ensure it meets each of those requirements.
- Modeler
> The modeler takes the overall responsibility for the successful initiation, planning, design, execution, monitoring, controlling and closure of a project requirements and compiles them into UML diagrams that represent the system that will be implemented.
- UI Designer
> The UI designer is responsible for identifying and designing a user interface for the application that realizes the application's requirements in a visual way.
- Developer
> The developer is responsible for transforming the application's requirements and design into a working application.
- Tester
> The tester is responsible for writing and executing the test cases for the application, as well as ensuring that the application is reasonably free from defects.
- Project Manager
> The Project Manager is responsible for the overall implementation of the project including planning, design, execution, monitoring, controlling and closure of a project.
- Data modeler
> Understands the system requirements and the persistence requirements. Models and creates database tables.
