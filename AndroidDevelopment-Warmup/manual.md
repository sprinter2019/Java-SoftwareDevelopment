What this app does:
This app is a simple cipher tool that can be used to encrypt a message using the following algorithm:
The first letter of the input message (which is a non-empty string) gets shifted by a key. The key is an integer and a user input between 1 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive). The following letters get shifted by a new key number generated by adding an increment number to the preceding key number. Increment number is also an integer and a user input between 1 (inclusive) and 26 (exclusive). Only the letters (regardless of the case) gets shifted by this method and any other character remains unchanged. An example is shown in the image below:

How to use the app:
There are three input fields : ‘Message’ input filed takes the user input as a string that needs to be encrypted. A valid input message can not be null, must contain at least one letter, and can contain any letter, number, or special characters. The ‘Key Number’ and ‘Increment Number’ are integer inputs and must be >=1 and <26. For invalid input message and or out of bound key or increment number, the corresponding field generates error messages to alert the user. When the ‘ENCRYPT’ button is pressed, for a valid set of inputs, the ‘Encrypted Message’ filed generates the encrypted message using the algorithm explained above. If any of the input filed contains invalid entry, the app generates an empty string upon pressing this button.

Additional Note: This project was built using the Android Studio App (Not IntelliJ IDE). I had difficulty running this project on IntelliJ.
